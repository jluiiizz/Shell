# JShell

A simple shell built with C language

## Objective

The main purpose of this project is learn more about the C language and test my knowledge. But also do a organized project,from the structure to the code, doing my best in everything.

## Upcoming Features

- Check the **TODO.md** file for see what is going to be added.

## Download and instalation

At least for now i don't want to provide this project for general use. It's in very recent form, missing a lot of features that other shell have.

- But if you still want to test it you can clone the repository and use **GCC** to compile it.

```
gcc main.c -o jshell.exe
```

- If you tested it, feel free to report bugs on issues and contribute to the project.

## Possible future

In a possible future i want to maybe try to focus this shell in Mathematical Calculation, like a built-in "Wolfram", helping people who need a quickly use of this kind of functionality.
